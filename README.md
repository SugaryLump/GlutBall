# GlutBall
A sphere launcher with OpenGL. Made quickly just for fun, code is very rough. 
 - B to launch ball
 - M to toggle FPS camera
 - R to rapid-fire balls
 - Q to shotgun a spread of balls
 - E to rapid-fire spreads of balls
 - K to launch rocket ball
No real optimizations have been employed. Any considerable amount of balls will rapidly tank framerates.
Enjoy!
